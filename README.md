The Medkit app is a mobile drug delivery service that enables you to locate the closest pharmacy, access the store, 
purchase the necessary medications, and have them delivered to your home. Because Medkit is an online pharmacy, 
users don't have to worry about standing in line, traveling far to find a particular drug they couldn't find locally, 
or being in a situation where there isn't a pharmacy nearby. Instead, they can access the drug on Medkit without any hassle.</p>
